<h1>The Theme of My Choice : Sparlking by Colorlib. </h1>

Why? 
	
	-the layout of the theme is very clean, neat & simple: I dont want to look at a web blog with messy layout and unpleant color pallet!

	-easy to navigate through & use: you can 'see' what is a button and what is a heading of the post, what section is for the post. 


<h1>Plug-in of My Choice </h1>

1. Google Analytics Dashboard for WP: 

This plug-in create a section in the wordpress dashbaord 
and shows the statistics. Makes life easier. I dont have to go look for the information. The stats sits right there waiting for me. 

2. Tweet, Like, Google +1 and Share

This plug-in creates tiny buttons in your post (you can customise where you want to show this buttons available) for visitors to like, tweet, google+1 and share your post. 

 Many people use social media of some sorts and share information online. Making that option available seems like a good choice.
