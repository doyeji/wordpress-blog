<h1>The Theme of My Choice : Sparlking by Colorlib. </h1>

<p>Why? </p>
<ol>
	
	<li>the layout of the theme is very clean, neat & simple: I dont want to look at a web blog with messy layout and unpleant color pallet!</li>

	<li>easy to navigate through & use: you can 'see' what is a button and what is a heading of the post, what section is for the post. </li>
</ol>

<h1>Plug-in of My Choice </h1>
<ol>
<li><h3>1. Google Analytics Dashboard for WP: </h3>

<p>This plug-in create a section in the wordpress dashbaord 
and shows the statistics. Makes life easier. I dont have to go look for the information. The stats sits right there waiting for me.</p> </li>

<li><h3>2. Tweet, Like, Google +1 and Share</h3>

<p>This plug-in creates tiny buttons in your post (you can customise where you want to show this buttons available) for visitors to like, tweet, google+1 and share your post. </p>

 <p>Many people use social media of some sorts and share information online. Making that option available seems like a good choice.</p>  </li>
